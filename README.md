# :briefcase: Portfolio - Robert Rozwadowski
## :eye: About me
I'm a college graduate in electrical engineering, where for my engineering thesis and master's thesis I built my own devices based on microcontrollers. The built devices had to be tested, whether it correctly implements all the planned functions and whether the software code works as expected. This is where I first encountered the subject of software testing, which interested me a lot and I would like to work with it on a daily basis. In college, for 3.5 years I received scholarship, which is given for learning results, for the best students. It proves my industriousness, ability to learn quickly, willingness to develop and to learn new subjects in detail. My studies also developed my soft skills, such as: logical thinking, teamwork, creativity, time management and timeliness, being well organized, the ability to work under time pressure and resistance to stress. Since my youth, I've been captivated by the concept of computers and their functioning. Eager to develop my skills in the topics of testing and programming. I'm currently participating in various projects on the uTest platform. Seeking to become an automation tester. Below is a list of all the sources I used and gained knowledge from, as well as projects created from scratch by me, during the process of learning. I'm constantly improving my professional competence and language skills.
